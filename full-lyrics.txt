I'm insecure
Of that I'm sure
Don't need a counselor or seminar to see
And even when it's only you and me
There seems to be
Somethin' that you keep behind your teeth
You think I would know
How this would go
But maybe that's exactly where I want it
No need to hope
Count to three
You get what you see
And every time you go, I'm here thinkin'
"Maybe it's me"
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
You think I'd know better by now
(By now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now, by now...)
I fill my calendar with stuff I can do
Maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
And I'm pretendin' you ain't been on my mind
But I took an interest in the things that you like, ah-ah
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now
But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hopin' you'd text me so I could tell you
I been thinkin' 'bout your touch like
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Makin' me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
And yeah, it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
But can you blame me when you keep me on the fence, like?
And I've been waitin', hopin' that you'd wanna text like
Text like
It's what I was born to do
And yeah, it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
But can you blame me when you keep me on the fence, like?
And I've been waitin', hopin' that you'd wanna text like (Hey!)
Text like
Ugh
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now
But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hopin' you'd text me so I could tell you
I been thinkin' 'bout your touch like
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Makin' me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
Sorry Uh, alright
I can't focus on what needs to get done
I'm on notice hoping that you don't run, ah
You think I'm tepid but I'm misdiagnosed
'Cause I'm a stalker, I seen all of your posts, ah-ah
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now
Mhm
You make it difficult to not overthink
I hope you don't think I'm rude
But I wanna make out with you
And I'm a little awkward, sure
But I could touch my face to yours, oh
And no one ever called me smooth
But I just wanna see the grooves between your hands, your teeth, oh
Tell me, do you think about me?
I just wanna kiss you
And even if I miss you
At least I'll know what it's like to have held your hand, oh!
No-o, hey!
Bad ideas, ay (oh!)
I know where they lead (hey, oh!)
But I have too many to sleep
And I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh, no!
And if tomorrow makes me low (oh!)
Well it'd be worth it just to know
'Cause I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
O-oh!
Hey!
I don't know what compels me
To do the very thing that fells me
I wake up, still high on you
But by the night I'm crashing through
So why'd I wanna kiss you
Even though I miss you
Guess I just wanted to know what it would feel like, oh!
No-o, hey!
Bad ideas, ay (oh!)
I know where they lead (hey, oh!)
But I have too many to sleep
And I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh, no!
And if tomorrow makes me low (oh!)
Well it'd be worth it just to know
'Cause I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh!
Singing's a bad look on me
And if I'm talking honestly
It takes everything I got not to text, and
I just want a kiss to get me through
'Cause now all my bed-sheets smell like you, so
If you think you miss me
Come on back and kiss me
I just gotta know what you and I would feel like, oh!
No-o, hey!
Yikes
Bad ideas, ay (oh!)
I know where they lead (hey, oh!)
But I have too many to sleep
And I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh, no!
And if tomorrow makes me low (oh!)
Well it'd be worth it just to know
'Cause I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Hey!
And when I'm with you I turn all shades of pink, ah
I wanna touch you but don't wanna be weird
It's such a rush, I'm thinking wish you were here, ah-ah
And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now
But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hopin' you'd text me so I could tell you
I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Makin' me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
Sorry
I've got a radar for trouble and you're a renegade
I take a leap and I stumble while you are unafraid
I keep repeating, repeating the way you say my name
Oh, oh
(Mm)
I try convincing my friends that you're not right for me
We just don't make any sense, but still you fight for me
I keep repeating, repeating the way we shouldn't be
Oh, oh
Well I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
Ooh
I know I shouldn't be guessing but you're impressing me
And I can't help reading into what you've been texting me
I keep repeating, repeating the way we shouldn't be
Oh, oh
(Mm)
And yeah I know I don't need it but wouldn't it be neat
We fall in love with a feeling just feeling you and me
I keep repeating repeating the way we shouldn't be
Oh, oh!
Well I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
Ooh
Get everything that you want, my love, my time, my money
You think I'd learn but I love your touch it is sweet like honey
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear you call me funny
Guess I'm a sucker for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
Ooh
I don't want a piece of that
'Cause I know there's no peace in that
I can tell myself a thousand times
But you can make a toy of me, and I'll agree
That maybe I just couldn't see, couldn't see that
There ain't nothing wrong with us at all
But you keep on playing games with me, games
And you always gotta play with me, play
And I hate the way you break, and you take, and you tear me down
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now
Games with me, games
And you always gotta play with me, play
And I hate the way you break, and you take, and you tear me down
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now
I know I should trust my gut
'Cause I know that there's something up
I just hate the place that that path would lead me down
And you say that there's nothing wrong, and I long
To take you at your word, but then all along
You're hiding even when you're by my side
And you keep on playing games with me, games
And you always gotta play with me, play
And I hate the way you break, and you take, and you tear me down
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now
Games with me, games
And you always gotta play with me, play
And I hate the way you break, and you take, and you tear me down
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now
You're lying
And everything with you is trying
And I don't wanna keep on crying
If I'm the only one
And I've been
Telling everyone I'm fine, when
I feel like I lost my mind
Am I the only one?
If I knew it all along, was I wrong
To take you at your word, but then all along
You're hiding even when you're by my side
And you keep on playing games with me, games
And you always gotta play with me, play
And I hate the way you break, and you take, and you tear me down
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now
Games with me, games
And you always gotta play with me, play
And I hate the way you break, and you take, and you tear me down
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now
You're lying
And everything with you is trying
And I don't wanna keep on crying
If I'm the only one
And I've been
Telling everyone I'm fine, when
I feel like I lost my mind
Am I the only one?
Boy, you really oughta knock it off right now Spent the winter pretendin' I'm okay
And I love a sinner 'cause they look the other way
But I been goin' under, pretendin' that I'm okay
I'm a girl of thunder, wishin' all the world away like
Wine with dinner, I talk but I don't say
How I been (Feelin')
How I been (Feelin' about, hey!)
All of these (Feelings)
Or do you want me now?
How I been (Feelin')
Pretendin' I'm (Dealin' without, hey!)
But I ain't (Feelin')
Or do you want me out? Ha!
Was it easy, decidin' you're not mine?
Do you feel me, do I ever cross your mind?
And I hate that you affect the way I feel at all
I don't deserve to find my footing just to fall and
Wine with dinner, I talk but I don't say
How I been (Feelin')
How I been (Feelin' about, hey!)
All of these (Feelings)
Or do you want me now?
How I been (Feelin')
Pretendin' I'm (Dealin' without, hey!)
But I ain't (Feelin')
Or do you want me out? Ha!
Now, voice, I don't need you to crack
No tellin' what you might say that I can't take back
And I don't think I can open up the door
I'm afraid to give a voice to what I'm wanting for
So I don't, or I can't, or I won't
But it's like I'm goin' crazy
Thinkin' about, mmm
How I been (Feelin')
How I been (Feelin' about, hey!)
All of these (Feelings)
Or do you want me now?
How I been (Feelin')
Pretendin' I'm (Dealin' without, hey!)
But I ain't (Feelin')
Or do you want me out? Ha! You're fire, you're proud
But you're cold when it counts
It's open and shut
You can say you love me
But - words ain't enough
You want me, you say
But then you turn away
And I'm pressing my luck
You can say you love me
But - words ain't enough
Cut myself into
Pieces easy to chew
Carve me up into
Someone you'd like to choose
Till I'm only pieces of you
So, you can say you love me
But - words ain't enough
So, you can say you love me
But - words ain't enough
It's 4 AM again
You think that I could sense a trend
I'm stayin' up too late just so I can stay awake
I wish I weren't so self-obsessed (Oh-oh)
Wish that I could be the best (Oh-oh, oh)
Excited with my words, but I'm nervous and I'm bored
(Bored, hey!)
I'm so bored of wakin' up, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Bored of what's inside my cup, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
I'm exhausted by my heart
I'd feel good if only I could finish what I start
I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
I'm never tired in my bed, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Of these thoughts inside my head, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Bored of bein' all alone
Just hopin' I'd find purpose in these pictures on my phone
My new habit of the week (Oh-oh)
Sayin' sorry when I speak (Oh-oh, oh)
I know that it's no good, there's no reason why I should
But it's stuck inside my head (Oh-oh, oh)
And I can't get out of bed (Oh-oh, oh)
I don't wanna be ignored, but I'm nervous and I'm bored
(Bored, hey!)
I'm so bored of wakin' up, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Bored of what's inside my cup, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
I'm exhausted by my heart
I'd feel good if only I could finish what I start
I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
I'm never tired in my bed, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Of these thoughts inside my head, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Bored of bein' all alone
Just hopin' I'd find purpose in these pictures on my phone
(Bored, hey!)
Easier to throw up the flag
Well I don't know
(Hey!)
Beat me up for bein' a drag
Well I've been dinin' I'm crazy
I'm filling up all these lies
Well I just wish you would love me, but I keep it all inside
I'm never tired in my bed, I'm so bored
Of these thoughts inside my head, I'm so bored
Bored of bein' all alone
Just hopin' I'd find purpose in these pictures on my phone
I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
I'm never tired in my bed, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Of these thoughts inside my head, I'm so bored (Bored, hey!)
Bored of bein' all alone
Just hopin' I'd find purpose in these pictures on my phone
You look too hard then you see it's a joke
And, yeah, you think you're tapped but it's nothin' but smoke, oh-oh
You want it better but you, you only choke
Is this all there is? Is this all there is?
Is this all there is? Is this all there is?
Is this all there is? Is this all there... 
Separate me from the rest of the herd so
I can run away from all of my hurt, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say like
I can pretend that I don't wanna end, I'm afraid
(And dangerous)
Weave a story so I don't have to talk, no
It's not a problem if I never get caught, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say like
I can pretend that I don't wanna end, I'm afraid
(And dangerous)
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I'm not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
(Hey)
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
Hatch demons where no one can see oh
Out of sight but in your mind you believe 'em
Drink what you want
Be what you want
Say what they want you to say like
I can pretend that I don't wanna end, I'm afraid
Do you think, do you think that they notice?
I keep a bottle by my bed it's a focus
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say like
I can pretend that I don't wanna end, I'm afraid
(And dangerous)
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I'm not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
This is not a problem if I don't want it to stop
Can't call it a problem if I never let a play drop
This is not a problem if convincin' that it's not
Don't call it a problem, it's the only thing that I still got
Hey, oh
Hey, I know
Down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I'm not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
Here's the truth: my strength ain't being honest
I mostly work from wanting to be wanted
And if there's something else, well I don't know if I got it
And come the night I'm never really solid
Guess I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
I'm no good tonight. no. I don't feel alright at all
Guess I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
1 2 3 and 4, how long till I feel like myself again? and
I'd walk out the door but... where would I go?
Try and hide from what's inside you. you can run but it can find you
Where would I go? where would you go?
Flattery's my choice of weapon; poison tastes like my resentment
Where would I go? where would you go?
Guess I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
I'm no good tonight. no. I don't feel alright at all
Guess I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
Oh. sometimes I feel like there's no where else to go
And every road I take is leading me back
And lonely is the girl who doesn't let it show
But every road I take is leading me back
Funny to notice that about yourself like all at once I realize I didn't want to see it
And if I been going crazy maybe it's because I keep on telling myself a story: that I should be doing fine by now
Hey, hey, it's okay
Hey, hey, you're okay
Guess I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
I'm not doing well. I'm not doing well
I'm no good tonight. no. I don't feel alright at all
Guess I'm not doing well. I'm not doing wellI woke up today, knowing no one really knows me
Don't know what to say
All I know is that I'm lonely
But I don't fuck around
I remove you with a cleft
But now I've put you down, I'm afraid I've nothing left
God, I want a touch of something new
Something I can keep
All I know is everything I do don't bare me no relief
Ooh, ooh
Smile button on
I bought it off the shelf
And I've been telling all my friends I've just been working on myself
Wish that I could learn to trust someone would want to put me first
But I can't deign to hope while I'm bracing for the worst
God, I want a touch of something new
Something I can keep
All I know is everything I do don't bare me no relief, mm
God, I want a piece of something new
Something I can hold
All I know is holding back won't help me learn to let it go
Ooh, ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Mm, mm
I woke up today, knowing no one really knows me
Don't know what to say
All I know is that I'm lonely
