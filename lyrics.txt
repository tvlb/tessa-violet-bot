Sofia Alexandrovna
[Sonya:]
How beautiful you looked in the snow

Cousin dear I love you
Trust no one but you
"But I can't bear this waiting", 'I cry and I cry
Andrey where are you?
I want him now, at once

"I'm full of childish vanities", 'I forget things
And I live in the past
"I've aged so very much", '
People enjoy me though
I come in for tea in my old-fashioned coat and powdered wig
And I tell stories
And utter scathing critiques
This stern, shrewd old man
A relic of the past century
With his gentle daughter
Such a majestic and agreeable spectacle
[Mary:]
But besides the couple of hours during which we have guests
There are also twenty-two hours in the day
During which the private and intimate life of the house continues
[Bolkonsky:]
Bring my me slippers

[Bolkonsky:]
Bring me my wine

I can hurt you
[Mary & Bolkonsky:]
I can hurt you

And Countess Natalya Rostova is coming for tea
[Natasha:]
"I know they'll like me", 'Everyone has always liked me

Natasha is young
And worthless and dumb

"Will I never be anyone's wife?", '

"Ah, what's this? A young suitor?", 'Ah, come in, come in

Ah, come in my dear

And he draws her to him
And he kisses her hand
Embraces her affectionately
And I flush and run out of the room
[Bolkonsky:]
Come back here
Let an old man have his fun
[Mary:]
"But she's just using you papa", 'Wants your money papa!
To take advantage of your weakness like that
"It's disgusting", 'My voice breaks

"It's my money and I'll throw it where I want", 'Not at you!
"And not at Andrey's harlot!", '
Insolent girl!
Insolent girl!
Where

Where are my glasses?
Where are they?
Where are my glasses?
Oh God
"Oh God I'm frightened", "Oh God I've aged so very much", '
Where are my glasses?
Where are my glasses?
[Mary:]
They are there upon his head
The pride of sacrifice
Gathers in my soul
And he forgets things
He falls asleep at the table
His napkin drops to the floor
His shaking head
Sinks over his plate
He is old and feeble
And I dare to judge him
I disgust myself
[Servant:]
May I present the Countess
Natalya Rostova
[Mary:]
Oh
Oh, hello
"Won't you come in?", '
[Natasha:]
Hello
[Natasha and Mary awkwardly move to a table in silence
[Mary:]
And from the first glance I do not like Natasha
Too fashionably dressed
Frivolous and vain
Her beauty, youth, and happiness
"My brother's love for her", '
And my father
[Bolkonsky:]
I do not wish to see her!
[Mary:]
I know at any moment he might indulge in some freak
[Natasha:]
"I'm sorry the Prince is still ailing", '
[Bolkonsky:]
Songstress!
[Natasha:]
I am not afraid of anyone
But such hesitation
Such unnatural manners
And from the first glance I do not like Princess Mary
Too plain and affected
Insolent and dry
I shrink into myself
Assume an offhand air
[Mary:]
Which alienates me still more
[Natasha & Mary:]
Constrained and strained
Constrained and strained
Constrained and strained
Irksome
Irksome
[The Prince enters in his underthings
[Bolkonsky:]
Oh!
[Mary:]
Papa!
[Bolkonsky:]
Oh, so this is Natasha
Not much to look at
Says the mean old man in his underthings
I never dress for children or peasants
Says the mean old man in his underthings
[Mary:]
And he looked at her once
Head to toe
And left muttering
[Natasha:]
I must take my leave
[Mary:]
Please wait
Dear Natalie
I want you to know how glad I am my brother has found happiness
[Natasha:]
Is that the truth?
I think it is not convenient to speak of that now
Dear Princess
[Mary:]
She said
With such dignity and coldness
[Natasha:]
What have I said, what have I done?
Crying like a child
Oh, they were so awful!
Oh, it all hurts so terribly
Andrey
Where are you?

[Natasha:]
The moon
First time I heard your voice
Moonlight burst into the room
And I saw your eyes
And I saw your smile
And the world opened wide
And the world was inside of me
And I catch my breath
And I laugh and blush
And I hear guitars
You are so good for me
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you
Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
"I'll never be this happy again", 'You and I
And no one else

"We've done this all before", 'We were angels once
"Don't you remember?", 'Joy and life
Inside our souls
And nobody knows
Just you and me
"It's our secret", '
This winter sky
How can anyone sleep?
There was never such a night before!
I feel like putting my arms round my knees
And squeezing tight as possible
And flying away
Like this...
Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
"I'll never be this happy again", 'You and I
You and I
You and I
And no one else

"Maybe he'll come today", 'Maybe he came already
"And he's sitting in the drawing room", 'And I simply forgot 
[Marya D:]
The opera, the opera!
"Stop mooning and moaning, we'll miss the curtain!", '
[Servant:]
Ladies
Welcome to the opera
[Sonya:]
Bare arms and shoulders
Brilliant uniforms
Pearls and silk
Glittering before our eyes
Feminine envy
A whole crowd of memories
Desires and emotions
Natasha, smooth your gown
[Chorus:]
Natasha, smooth your gown
[Natasha:]
Looking in the glass
I see I am pretty
Not a girl anymore
"I've never felt like this before", '
Hundreds of eyes
Looking at my bare arms
My bare arms and neck
My bare arms and shoulders
[Chorus:]
The two remarkably pretty girls
Had not been seen in Moscow in many years
"Everybody knew vaguely of Natasha's engagement", 'One of the finest matches in all of Russia
[Sonya:]
"Look, there's Alexey, home from the war at last", '
[Marya D:]
He has changed
Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!
[Chorus:]
"There's Boris and Julie, engaged", 'And Anna Mikhaylovna, what a headdress she has on!
[Hélène:]
And is that Natasha
[Chorus:]
And is that Natasha
And is that Natasha
[Natasha:]
They are looking at me
They are talking about me!
They all like me so much
The women envious
The men calming their jealousy
[Servant:]
Announcing Fedya Dolokhov
"He dominates Moscow's most brilliant young men", 'He stands in full view
"Well aware he's attracting attention", 'Yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room
[Marya D:]
Dolokhov was in the Caucasus
"And he killed the Shah's brother!", 'Now all the Moscow ladies are mad about him
Dolokhov the assassin!
[Servant:]
Announcing Countess Hélène Bezukhova
The queen of society
Beautiful, barely clothed
Plump bare shoulders, and much-exposed neck
Round which she wears a double string of pearls
[Chorus:]
Hélène and Dolokhov, arm in arm
Pierre the cuckold sits at home
Pierre the cuckold sits at home
The poor man
[Pierre:]
No, I am enjoying myself at home this evening
[Natasha:]
Oh, that neck
Oh, those pearls
[Hélène:]
So beautiful
What a charming young girl
So enchanting
[Natasha:]
I blush scarlet
[Marya D:]
"Countess Bezukhova, Pierre's wife", 'Have you been here long?
And where is dear Pierre?
He never used to forget us
[Natasha:]
Yes Pierre, that good man
A little sad, a little stout
He must come visit us
[Hélène:]
I will implore him to do so
[Marya D:]
"There's a woman one should stay far away from", '
Now Natasha
The curtain rises
[Chorus:]
The curtain rises
[Natasha:]
Everyone in the boxes and the stalls became silent
All the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress
All the women in the hall
With gems on their bare flesh
Turned their whole attention
With curiosity to the stage
[Two singers perform a scene from an avant-garde opera. It is grotesque and amazing
[Natasha:]
Grotesque and amazing
I cannot follow the opera
Or even listen to the music
I see painted cardboard
Queerly dressed actors
Moving and singing so strangely in the lights
So false and unnatural
"I'm ashamed and amused", 'And everyone else seems oblivious
Yes everyone feigns delight
[Sonya:]
And feeling the flood of brilliant lights
The warm perfumed air heated by the crowd
Natasha little by little
Began to pass into a state of intoxication
[Natasha:]
"Oh I'd tickle you all if I could", "Oh I'd tickle you all if I could", '
[Sonya:]
And then
A rush of cold air
[Natasha & Sonya:]
An exceptionally handsome man walked in
With a confident yet courteous air
[Hélène:]
"This was Hélène's brother", 'Anatole Kuragin
He moved with a swagger
Which would have been ridiculous
Had he not been so good-looking
And though it was the middle of the act
He walked right down the aisle
His sword and spurs jangling
His handsome perfumed head held high
And he looked right at Natasha
[Anatole:]
Mais charmante
[Hélène:]
And he took his place in the front row next to Dolokhov
[Natasha:]
How handsome he is
How intoxicating
[Sonya:]
In the second act there were tombstones
The moon over the footlights
Horns and contrabass
Black cloaks and daggers in their hands
[Natasha:]
I turn around again and our eyes meet
He gazes straight into my eyes
He is talking about me
[Sonya:]
Candles burning
A crimson throne
The Tsar wails a mournful tune
They all wave their arms
And everybody cheers
"Bravo, bravo!"
[Natasha:]
Every time I look at him
"He's looking at me", 'Every time I look at him
"He's looking at me", 'Every time I look at him
[Sonya:]
A terrible noise, a clatter in the crowd
A storm of chromatic scales and diminished sevenths
With rapturous faces everyone was shouting
Screaming and shouting, "Bravo!"
[Chorus:]
Bravo, bravo
Bravo, bravo
Bravo, bravo
[Sonya:]
And then
A rush of cold air
And Anatole entered the box 
[Anatole:]
I have long wished to have this happiness
"Ever since the Naryshkins' ball", 'Where I had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing you
How do you like the performance?
Last week Semenova fell down on the stage
[Natasha:]
He is sensible and simple
Bold and natural
So strange and agreeable
There is nothing formidable
His smile is most naive
Cheerful and good-natured
"And he's as handsome up close as at a distance", "And he's as handsome up close as at a distance", '
[Anatole:]
And do you know, Natasha
We are having a costume tournament soon
You ought to come, please come!
[Natasha:]
Oh
[Anatole:]
You ought to come, please come!
[Natasha:]
Oh, I
[Anatole:]
And I never remove my smiling eyes
From your face, your neck, your bare arms
And I never remove my smiling eyes
From your face, your neck, your bare arms
[Natasha:]
I know for certain that he is taken by me
I know for certain that he is enraptured by me
I feel him looking at my shoulders
My face, my neck, my bare arms
[Anatole:]
And I look you in the eye
[Natasha & Anatole:]
And I look you in the eye
[Natasha:]
And looking into his eyes
I am frightened
"There's not that barrier of modesty", "I've always felt with men", 'I feel so terribly near
I fear that he may seize me from behind
And kiss me on the neck
How do you like Moscow?
[Anatole:]
At first I did not like it much
Because what makes a town pleasant
Ce sont les jolies femmes
"Isn't that so?", 'But now I like it very much indeed
Do come to the costume tournament Countess
Do come!
You will be the prettiest there
You will be the prettiest there
Do come, dear Countess, and give me this flower as a pledge
We are speaking of most ordinary things
[Natasha:]
"Yet I feel closer to you than I've ever felt with any other man", 'No one else is here
No one else can see us
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Oh your eyes
[Anatole:]
"It's all right, Natasha, I'm here", '
[Anatole & Natasha:]
So near
Nothing between us
Smile at me
There is nothing between us
[Anatole:]
Good evening, Pierre
Studying?
[Pierre:]
Yes
How was the opera?
[Anatole:]
Lovely
Natalya Rostova was there
[Pierre:]
Oh?
"Dear Andrey's betrothed?", 'I have known her family for years and long carried affection
For her
[Anatole:]
Yes
Charming
"Look, Dolokhov's coming around", "And we're off to the club", 'Will you come, old man?
[Pierre:]
I will come
[Anatole:]
Lend me fifty rubles?
[Dolokhov:]
Drink, drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink, gonna drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna
[Dolokhov, Anatole & Pierre:]
Drink, drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna, gonna drink, gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
[All:]
Drink with me, my love
"For there's fire in the sky", "And there's ice on the ground", 'Either way, my soul will die
Whoa...
[Pierre:]
The doctors warned me
That with my corpulence
[All:]
Corpulence!
[Pierre:]
Vodka and wine are dangerous for me
But I drink a great deal
Only quite at ease
After pouring several glasses mechanically
Into my large mouth
[Pierre & all:]
Then I feel
A pleasant warmth in my body
A sentimental attachment to my fellow man
[Hélène:]
Keep drinking old man
[Anatole & Dolokhov:]
Keep drinking old man
Drink the whole night through
Keep drinking old man
[All:]
Keep drinking old man
Drink the whole night through
Keep drinking old man
[Anatole:]
Natasha, Natasha
Her arms, her shoulders, her neck, her feet
[Hélène:]
The air of a connoisseur
[Anatole:]
I will make love to her
[Dolokhov:]
Better not, monsieur
"She's first rate, but nothing but trouble", '
[Dolokhov & Hélène:]
"Better wait till she's married", '
[Dolokhov:]
Anatole is a married man
A fact known only to his intimates
A Polish landowner of some small means
Had forced him to marry his daughter
[Anatole:]
Nevermind about that now
"It doesn't matter", "I don't give a damn", 'Just as a duck is made to swim in water
God has made me as I am
All I care for is gaiety and women
"And there's no dishonor in that", "As long as there's money and vodka", "I'll keep a feather in my hat", '
[All:]
Whoa...
[Pierre:]
I used to love
I used to love
I used to be better
[All:]
Keep drinking old man
[Hélène:]
Drink, drink, drink
God to think I married a man like you
[Pierre:]
"Don't speak to me, wife", 'There is something inside me...
[Hélène:]
Dolokhov, pour me another
[Pierre:]
Something terrible and monstrous
[Dolokhov:]
"Here's to the health of married women", 'And a smile lurks at the corner of my mouth
"Here's to the health of married women", 'And their lovers!
[Dolokhov & all:]
"Here's to the health of married women", "Here's to the health of married women", 'And their lovers!

"Here's to the health of married women", "Here's to the health of married women", 'And their lovers!
[Pierre:]
How dare you touch her?
[Dolokhov:]
"You can't love her", '
[Pierre:]
Enough!
You bully, you scoundrel
I challenge you
[Dolokhov:]
Oh, a duel?
Yes, this is what I like
[Hélène:]
He will kill you, stupid husband
[Pierre:]
So I shall be killed
What is it to you?
Anatole, my guns
[Anatole:]
Oh, this is horribly stupid
[Dolokhov:]
"Well, let's begin", "This is child's play", '
[Servant/Denisov:]
As the adversaries have refused a reconciliation
We shall please proceed with the duel
Ready your pistols
And on the count of tri
Begin to advance
[All:]
Rahz! Dva! Tri!
[Anatole:]
Pierre, hold your fire
Pierre, hold your fire
Pierre, not yet!
[Pierre shoots Dolokhov
[Dolokhov:]
No!
Shot by a fool!
[Pierre:]
"No, wait, I didn't mean", '
[Dolokhov:]
Quiet, old man!
My turn
[Pierre:]
My turn...
[Anatole:]
Pierre, stand back!
[Hélène screams
[Dolokhov:]
Missed, missed
Oh my mother, my angel
My adoréd angel mother
[Hélène:]
Take him away
[Servant/Denisov:]
The sun is rising
The duel is at an end
And Pierre Bezukhov is the winner
[Pierre:]
Winner
[Hélène:]
You are a fool
[Anatole:]
Well, sweet sister
You certainly bring out the beast in men
[Hélène:]
What can I say?
"It's a gift", '
[Anatole:]
How I adore you
Will you ask Natasha to the ball tonight?
[Hélène:]
Of course, dear brother
[Anatole:]
Come on, old man
"Let's get you home", '
[Pierre:]
In a moment
[Anatole:]
Sleep it off
And be happy
We live to love another day

[Pierre:]
Is this how I die?
Ridiculed and laughed at
Wearing clown shoes
Is this how I die?
Furious and reckless
Sick with booze
How did I live?
I taste every wasted minute
Every time I turned away
From the things that might have healed me
How long have I been sleeping?
Is this how I die?
Frightened like a child
Lazy and numb
Is this how I die?
Pretending and preposterous
And dumb
How did I live?
Was I kind enough and good enough?
Did I love enough?
Did I ever look up
And see the moon
And the stars
And the sky?
Oh why have I been sleeping?
They say we are asleep
Until we fall in love
We are children of dust and ashes
But when we fall in love we wake up
And we are a god
And angels weep
But if I die here tonight
I die in my sleep
All of my life I spent searching the words
Of poets and saints and prophets and kings
"And now at the end all I know that I've learned", "Is that all that I know is I don't know a thing", '
So easy to close off
Place the blame outside
Hiding in my room at night
So terrified
All the things I could have been
But I never had the nerve
Life and love
"I don't deserve", '
So all right, all right
"I've had my time", 'Close my eyes
Let the death bells chime
Bury me in burgundy
"I just don't care", "Nothing's left", 'I looked everywhere
Is this how I die?
Was there ever any other way my life could be?
Is this how I die?
Such a storm of feelings inside of me?
But then why am I screaming?
Why am I shaking?
Oh god, was there something that I missed?
Did I squander my divinity?
Was happiness within me the whole time?
They say we are asleep
Until we fall in love
We are children of dust and ashes
But when we fall in love we wake up
And we are a god
And angels weep
But if I die here tonight
I die in my sleep
They say we are asleep
Until we fall in love
"And I'm so ready", 'To wake up now
I want to wake up
"Don't let me die while I'm like this", 'I want to wake up
"God don't let me die while I'm like this", 'Please let me wake up now
"God don't let me die while I'm like this", "I'm ready", "I'm ready", 'To wake up 
[Sonya:]
Early Sunday morning
Natasha and I lit a candle
Looked in the mirror
[Natasha:]
I see my face
[Sonya:]
"Don't be silly", '
They say you can see your future
In the long row of candles
Stretching back and back and back
Into the depths of the mirror
In the dim confused last square
"You'll see a coffin or a man", 'Everyone sees a man
[Natasha:]
I see the candles
Stretching back
So far away
I see the mirrors
I see a shape in the darkness
Is it him or is it
"He's lying down", 'Oh Sonya why is he lying down?
"I'm so frightened!", '
Andrey will never come
Or something will happen to me before he does
[Marya D:]
Sunday morning!
Time for church!
[Natasha:]
I suffer more now than before
The theater and Anatole
That man who aroused such terrible feelings
"I don't understand", 'Have I broken faith with Andrey?
Am I guilty?
[Sonya:]
"After church, Marya left for Prince Bolkonsky's", '
[Marya D:]
The rudeness of that man!
"I'll straighten him out!", '
[Natasha:]
That terrible old Prince
"I can't bear to think of it", "I'll shut myself in my room", 'And try on new dresses
[Sonya:]
And just after Marya left
There was a knock at the door
Natasha had just turned her head to the glass
When she heard a voice that made her flush
[Hélène:]
Oh my enchantress
Oh you beautiful thing
Charming, charming
Oh, this is really beyond anything
These dresses suit you
This one, "metallic gauze"
Straight from Paris
Anything suits you, my charmer
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Charmante, charmante!
You are such a lovely thing
Oh where have you been?
"It's such a shame to bury pearls in the country", 'Charmante, charmante, charming
Now if you have a dress
You must wear it out
How can you live in Moscow and not go nowhere?
So you love somebody, charming
"But that's no reason to shut yourself in", "Even if you're engaged", 'You must wear your dress out somewhere
My brother dined with me yesterday
"But he didn't eat a thing", "Cause he was thinking 'bout you", 'He kept sighing about you
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Charmante, charmante!
You are such a lovely thing
Oh where have you been?
"It's such a shame to bury pearls in the country", 'Charmante, charmante, charming
Now a woman with a dress
Is a frightening and powerful thing
You are not a child
"When you're draped in scarlet and lace", 'Your fiancé would want you to have fun
Rather than be bored to death
Alliez dans le monde
"Plutôt que de dépérir d'ennui!", '
My brother is quite madly in love
He is quite madly in love with you, my dear
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Charmante, charmante!
You are such a lovely thing
Oh where have you been?
"It's such a shame to bury pearls in the country", 'Charmante, charmante, charming
Such a shame to bury pearls in the country
Charmante, charmante, charming
[Natasha:]
What once seemed so terrible
Now seems simple and natural
"She knows that I'm engaged", 'And still she talks so frankly
So it must be all right!
[Hélène:]
There is a ball at my house tonight
You must come
Oh your wide-open, wondering eyes!
You will be the prettiest there!
How the thought of throwing them together amuses me!
You must come
[Natasha:]
I will come

[Anatole:]
Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door, waiting
Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door, waiting
Oh, how I adore little girls
They lose their heads at once!
[The ball begins; they dance
[Natasha:]
I am seized by feelings of vanity and fear
There is no barrier between us
Whispers and moans, and ringing in my ear
There is no barrier between us
Divine, delicious, but I do not see or hear anything
"I'm borne away to a senseless world", 'So strange, so remote
"I don't know good from bad", 'Anatole
Anatole
"I'm so frightened", '
[Anatole:]
You are enchanting
[Natasha:]
And as we danced
He pressed my waist and hand
And told me I was
[Natasha & Anatole:]
Bewitching
[Anatole:]
And I love you
[Natasha & Anatole:]
Bewitching
[Anatole:]
And I love you
[Natasha:]
And during the ecossaise, he
[Natasha (Anatole):]
Gazed/(gaze) in my eyes
[Natasha:]
And said nothing, just
[Natasha (Anatole):]
Gazed/(gaze) in my eyes
[Natasha:]
My frightened eyes
Such confident tenderness
I could not say what I had to say
[Anatole:]
"Don't lower your eyes", 'I love you
I am in love, dear
I am in love
Gaze in my eyes
I love you
You are bewitching
What can I do
Darling, what can I do?
[Natasha:]
"Don't say such things", 'I am betrothed
I love another
[Anatole:]
"Don't speak to me of that!", 'When I tell you that I am madly, madly in love with you!
"Is it my fault that you're enchanting?", '
[Natasha:]
"I'm so frightened", "I don't understand anything tonight", '
[Anatole:]
"I'm here now", '
[Natasha breaks away
[Anatole:]
Natalie!
[Natasha:]
I can feel your eyes upon me
[Anatole:]
Blocking her path, I bring here face close to mine
[Natasha:]
His large, glittering, masculine eyes are so close to mine
That I see nothing else
[Anatole:]
Is it possible that I should never see you again?
I love you madly!
Can I never?
Natalie?
[Natasha:]
You press my arm
[Anatole:]
Natalie?
[Natasha:]
"You're hurting my hands!", '
[Anatole:]
Natalie?
[Natasha:]
"I don't understand", 'I have nothing to say
[They kiss
[Natasha:]
Burning lips pressed to mine
Tell me what just happened
"I'm trembling", 'So frightening
Andrey
But I love you
Of that there is no doubt
How else could all of this have happened?
How else could we have kissed?
It means that I have loved you from the first
It means that you are kind
Noble and splendid
And I could not help loving you
I will love you, Anatole
"I'll do anything for you", '
[Natasha & Anatole:]
"I'll do anything for you", '
[All:]
In nineteenth-century Russia, we write letters
We write letters
We put down in writing
What is happening in our minds

"Once it's on the paper, we feel better", 'We feel better
"It's like some kind of clarity", "When the letter's done and signed", '
[Pierre:]
Dear Andrey
Dear old friend
How goes the war?
Do we march on the French splendidly?
Do our cannons crack and cry?
Do our bullets whistle and sing?
Does the air reek with smoke?
I wish I were there
With death at my heels
Dolokhov is recovering
He will be all right, the good man
And Natasha is in town
Your bride to be, so full of life and mischief
I should visit
I hear she is more beautiful than ever
How I envy you and your happiness
Here at home I drink and read and drink and read and drink
"But I think I've finally found it", 'What my heart has needed

"For I've been studying the Kabal", "And I've calculated the number of the beast", 'It is Napoleon!
Six hundred three score and six
And I will kill him one day
"He's no great man", 'None of us are great men
"We're caught in the wave of history", 'Nothing matters
Everything matters
"It's all the same", 'Oh, if only I could not see "it"
This dreadful, terrible "it"
[All:]
In nineteenth-century Russia, we write letters
We write letters
We put down in writing
What is happening in our minds
[Natasha:]
Dear Andrey
What more can I write
After all that has happened?
What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?
Must I break it off?
These terrible questions
[Natasha & Pierre:]
I see nothing but the candle in the mirror
No visions of the future
So lost and alone
[Natasha:]
And what of Princess Mary?
[Mary:]
Dear Natasha
I am in deep despair at the misunderstanding there is between us
"Whatever my father's feelings might be", 'I beg you to believe that I cannot help loving you
He is a tired old man and must be forgiven
Please, come see us again
[Natasha:]
Dear Princess Mary
Oh, what am I to write!
How do I choose?
What do I do?
I shall never be happy again
[Pierre:]
These terrible questions
[Mary:]
"I'm so alone here", '
[Natasha & Pierre:]
So alone in here
[Mary:]
And I see nothing
[Natasha, Pierre & Mary:]
I see nothing but the candle in the mirror
No visions of the future
So lost and alone
[All:]
In nineteenth-century Russia, we write letters
We write letters
We put down in writing
What is happening in our minds
[Anatole:]
Dear Natalie
A love letter
A love letter
A love letter
[Natasha:]
A letter from him, from the man that I love
[Dolokhov:]
A letter which I composed
[All:]
A love letter
A love letter...
[Anatole:]
Natalie, Natalie, Natalie
I must love you or die
Natalie, Natalie, Natalie
If you love me, say yes
And I will come and steal you away
Steal you out of the dark
Natalie, Natalie, Natalie
I want nothing more
Natalie, Natalie, Natalie
I must love you or die
Natalie, Natalie, Natalie
If you love me, say yes
And I will come and steal you away
Steal you out of the dark
Natalie, Natalie, Natalie
I want nothing more
Just say yes
Just say yes
Just say yes
[Natasha:]
Yes, yes, I love him
How else could I have his letter in my hand?
I read it twenty times
Thirty times, forty times!
Each and every word
I love him, I love him 
[Sonya:]
How was it I noticed nothing?
How could it go so far?
"It can't be that she loves him", "It can't be", 'Natasha
[Natasha awakes and sees Sonya
[Natasha:]
"Sonya, you're back", 'And with the tender resolve that often comes at the moment of awakening
I embraced my friend
"But noticing Sonya's look of embarrassment", 'My face expressed confusion
And suspicion

"Sonya, you've read the letter?", '
[Sonya:]
Yes
[Natasha:]
"Oh Sonya, I'm glad", "I can't hide it any longer!", 'Now you know, we love one another!
Oh Sonya, he writes, he writes
He writes, he writes, he writes
[Sonya:]
And Andrey?
[Natasha:]
Oh Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!
"You don't know what love is", '
[Sonya:]
But Natasha, can that all be over?
[Natasha:]
I do not grasp the question
[Sonya:]
Are you refusing Prince Andrey?
[Natasha:]
"Oh, you don't understand anything!", "Don't talk nonsense, just listen", '
[Sonya:]
"But I can't believe it, I don't understand", 'How you loved one man a whole year
And suddenly
"You've only known him three days!", "Natasha, you're joking!", '
[Natasha:]
Three days?
"It seems to me I've loved him a hundred years", "It seems to me I've never loved anyone before", 'Not like this
I have no will
My life is his
"I'll do anything he wants me to", 'What can I do?
Sonya, what can I do?

"I'm so happy", 'And so frightened
"Why can't you understand?", 'I love him!
[Sonya:]
"Then I won't let it come to that, I shall tell!", 'Bursting into tears
[Natasha:]
What do you mean?
"For God's sake, if you tell, you are my enemy!", 'You want me to be miserable
You want to tear us apart
"For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me", 'I have confided in you
[Sonya:]
What has happened between you?
What has he said to you?
"Why doesn't he come to the house and openly ask for your hand?", 'Why this secrecy?
Have you thought what his secret reasons may be?
[Natasha:]
"I don't know what the reasons are", 'But there must be reasons!
"Sonya, one can't doubt him!", '
[Sonya:]
Does he love you?
[Natasha:]
Does he love me?
"Why, you've read his letter, you've seen him", "I can't live without him", '
[Sonya:]
Natasha, think of our family
And think of Prince Andrey
[Natasha:]
Andrey said I was free to refuse him
[Sonya:]
"But you haven't refused him, or have you?", '
[Natasha:]
Perhaps I have
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonsky
Would you think so badly of me?
[Sonya:]
"I won't succumb to your tender tone Natasha", "I don't trust him, Natasha!", "I'm afraid for you, Natasha!", 'Afraid you are going to your ruin
[Natasha:]
"Then I'll go to my ruin, yes I will, as soon as possible!", "But it's not your business!", "It won't be you, it'll be me, who'll suffer", 'Leave me alone, yes leave me alone!
I hate you Sonya!
I hate you Sonya!
I hate you, I hate you!
"You're my enemy forever!", '
[Sonya:]
I burst into sobs
[Natasha runs out of the room
[Natasha:]
"And without a moment's reflection", 'I wrote the answer to Princess Mary
"I'd been unable to write all morning", '
All our misunderstandings are at an end
Forget everything and forgive me
"But I can't be Andrey's wife", '
[Sonya:]
Hard as it is
In the coming days
I watch my friend
In her strange unnatural state
"Don't let her out of my sight", 'She trails off
Stares at nothing
Laughs at random
And the letters come
She waits by the window
And I listen at the door
Until one day
I see by the sad look on her face
There is a dreadful plan in her heart
I know you are capable of anything
I know you so well my friend
I know you might just run away
What am I to do?
Who do I ask for help?
Is it all on me?
Is it all on me?
I will stand in the dark for you
I will hold you back by force
I will stand here right outside your door
"I won't see you disgraced", 'I will protect your name and your heart
Because I miss my friend

"I know you've forgotten me", 'I know you so well my friend
I know you might just throw yourself over
"But I won't let you", "I won't let you", "It's all on me", '
And I remember this family
I remember their kindness
And if I never sleep again
I will stand in the dark for you
I will hold you back by force
I will stand here right outside your door
"I won't see you disgraced", 'I will protect your name and your heart
Because I miss my friend
Because I miss my friend
Because I miss you, my friend 
[Pierre runs into Anatole on the street. Pierre is drunk, Anatole in a hurry
[Pierre:]
Ah, Anatole! Where are you off too?
[Anatole:]
Pierre, good man
Tonight I go away, on an adventure
"You'll not be seeing me for some time", "I've found a new pleasure", "And I'm taking her away", "I'll send you a letter from Poland", '
[Pierre:]
Ha! An elopement!
Fool, you are married already!
[Anatole:]
"Don't talk to me of that!", 'I will not deprive myself of this one!
Tonight! I take her tonight!
Lend me fifty rubles?
[Pierre:]
"Ah, that's a true sage", 'Living in the moment
"What I wouldn't give to be like him!", '
[Dolokhov:]
"The plan for Natalie Rostova's abduction", 'Had all been arranged and the preparations made
On the day that Sonya decided to save her
That was the day that the game was to be played
Natasha was to be on her back porch at ten
Anatole and his troika would scoop her up and then
"They'd ride forty miles to the village of Kamenka", "Where an unfrocked priest was to make 'em get wed", "Then back into the troika off they'd go", 'Take the Poland highroad to the wedding bed
[Anatole:]
Passports, horses, ten thousand rubles I have taken from my sister
"And another ten thousand raised with Dolokhov's help", '
[Dolokhov:]
We were gathered in my study drinking up some tea
Just Anatole, the two wedding witnesses, and me
An abacus and paper money strewn on the desk
Persian rugs and bearskins hanging grotesque
Anatole was walking with his uniform unbuttoned
Walking to and fro
To and fro
To and fro
[Anatole & Dolokhov:]
To and fro
To and fro
To and fro
To and fro
[Dolokhov:]
Now wait!
You better
Just
Give it up now
Why dontcha
"While there's still time!", "You'd really better drop it all", 'Give it up now!
"While there's still time!", 'Do you know?
[Anatole:]
What, teasing again?
"Fool don't talk nonsense!", 'Go to the devil! Eh?
Really this is no time for your stupid jokes
[Dolokhov:]
I am not joking, I am talking sense
This is serious business, a dangerous business
Come here, come here, come here Anatole!
Why would I joke about it?
Me of all people
Who found the priest, raised the money, got the passports, got the horses?
[Anatole:]
And well I thank you for it
Do you think I am not grateful?
[Dolokhov:]
"And now you'll carry her away but will they let it stop there?", "You haven't thought this through or do you just don't care?", 'Now listen to me tell it to you one last time
They will take you to the court and convict you for your crime
"Already married and you're playing with a little girl", "Don't you know, don't you think, don't you know?", '
[Anatole:]
Nonsense, nonsense!
"I'm scowling and grimacing", "Didn't I explain it to you, didn't I, what?", '
[Dolokhov:]
And here Anatole
With the stubborn attachment small-minded people have
"For conclusions they've worked out for themselves", 'Repeated his argument to me for the hundredth time
[Anatole:]
"If this marriage isn't valid", "Then I'm off the hook", "But if it is valid, it really doesn't matter!", 'No one abroad is gonna know a thing about it
"Isn't that so now don't you know?", "Don't talk to me, don't don't what what", 'Ah go to hell now
"I'm clutching my hair!", "It's the very devil!", 'Here, feel how it beats!

"[He presses Dolokhov's hand to his heart. A light comes up on Natasha across the room]", '
Ah ma chere, ma chere
Quel pied, quel regard!
What a foot she has, what a glance!
A goddess!
And my handsome lips

Marya Dmitryevna tried to speak again but Natasha cried out
Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!
And she threw herself down on the sofa
[Marya D:]
Natasha!
Natalya...
I put a pillow under her head
Covered her with two quilts
Brought her a glass of lime-flower water
But Natasha did not respond
Well, let her sleep
Let her sleep
[Marya D. leaves
[Natasha:]
But Natasha was not asleep
Her face was pale
Her eyes wide open
All that night she did not sleep or weep
She sat at the window
Waiting for him 
[A servant hands a letter to Pierre
[Servant:]
A letter from Marya Dmitryevna asking you to come and visit her
On a matter of great importance
Relating to Andrey Bolkonsky and his betrothed
[Pierre:]
What?
What can they want with me?

"[He arrives at Marya D.'s]", '
[Marya D:]
"Pierre, old friend I'm sorry it's late", "I'm sorry I haven't seen you about", 'Where have you been?
Where have you been?
[Pierre:]
I have been studying
[Marya D:]
Pierre old friend, we need your help
Pierre old friend:] the family name!
We need your help
We need your help
"There's ruin at the door", '
[Pierre:]
Marya?
[Marya D:]
Natasha has let down the family
[Pierre:]
What?
[Marya D:]
Natasha has broken with Andrey
[Pierre:]
What?
[Marya D:]
Natasha has tried to elope
[Pierre:]
What?
[Marya D:]
Natasha and Anatole Kuragin!
[Pierre:]
What?!
[Marya D:]
We need your help
We need your help
"There's ruin at the door", '
[Pierre:]
Natasha, that charming girl?
"I can't believe my ears", 'So I am not the only man
Chained to a bad woman
And Anatole, that stupid child
"They'll lock him up for years", 'For Anatole is a married man!
[Marya D:]
"Married? He's married?", '
[Pierre:]
Yes
[Marya D:]
"Oh wait 'til I tell her", '
[Pierre:]
Poor Andrey
[Marya D:]
And when Andrey comes home
He will challenge Anatole to a duel
And get himself killed
And all will be ruined
You must go see your brother-in-law
And tell him that he must leave Moscow
And not dare to let me set my eyes on him again
[Pierre:]
At once
[Pierre:]
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
The blood rushes to my heart
"It's difficult to breathe", 'Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
Not at the ice hills
"Not at Matreshka's", "Not at Komoneno's", 'Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
To the Club
And at the Club all is going on as usual
The members eat their dinners
And gossip in small groups
[Pierre & chorus:]
"Have I heard of Kuragin's abduction?", 'Is it true Natasha is ruined?
[Pierre:]
Nonsense, nonsense
Nothing has happened
Everything is fine

"[Pierre's house]", '
[Anatole:]
Natasha
Natasha
It is essential that I see Natasha
How can I see her?
[Hélène:]
Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, hush Anatole

"[Marya D.'s house]", '
[Natasha:]
What? What?
"I don't believe that he is married", "I don't believe you", 'And I stare like a hunted wounded animal
"He can't be married!", '
"[Pierre's house]", '
[Servant (to Pierre):]
Good evening sir
Prince Anatole is in the drawing room with the Countess
[Hélène:]
Ah, Pierre
Sweet husband
"You don't know what a plight our Anatole has had", '
[Pierre:]
Be quiet
I will not greet you
At this moment you are more repulsive to me than ever
Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, must speak to you
[Anatole:]
Anatole followed with his usual jaunty step
But his face betrayed anxiety
[Pierre:]
Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him

[During this scene, Natasha prepares to poison herself
[Pierre:]
You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to elope, is that so?
[Anatole:]
Mon cher
"I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone", '
[Pierre:]
My face, already pale
Becomes distorted by fury
I seize you by the collar with my big big hands
And I shake you from side to side
Until your face shows a sufficient degree of terror
When I tell you I must talk to you!
[Anatole:]
Come now, this is stupid!
"What what, don't don't!", '
[Pierre:]
"You're a scoundrel and a blackguard", "And I don't know what deprives me of the pleasure", 'Of smashing your head in with this!
[He takes a heavy paperweight and lifts it threateningly, but at once puts it back in its place
Did you promise to marry her?
[Anatole:]
"I didn't think of it. I never promised, because", '
[Pierre:]
Have you any letters of hers?
Any letters?
"I shan't be violent, don't be afraid", '
[Anatole hands Pierre a pack of letters
First, the letters
Second, tomorrow you must get out of Moscow
[Anatole:]
But how can I?
[Pierre:]
Third
You must never breathe a word of what has happened between you and the Countess
"Now I know I can't prevent your doing so", 'But if you have a spark of conscience
[Pierre paces the room several times in silence
[Anatole:]
Anatole sits at a table frowning and biting his lips
[Pierre:]
After all, you must understand
That besides your pleasure
There is such a thing as other people
And their happiness and peace
And that you are ruining a whole life
For the sake of amusing yourself!
Amuse yourself with women like my wife
"With them you're within your rights", 'But to promise a young girl to marry her
To deceive, to kidnap
"Don't you understand that that's as cruel", 'As beating an old man or a child?
[Anatole:]
"Well, I don't know about that, eh?", "I don't know that and I don't want to", 'But you have used such words to me
"Scoundrel" and so on
Which as a man of honor
I will not allow anyone to use
[Pierre:]
Is it satisfaction you want?
[Anatole:]
You could at least take back your words, eh?
If you want me to do as you wish?
[Natasha drinks the poison
[Pierre:]
Fine, I take them back, I take them back!
And I ask you to forgive me
And if you require money for your journey
[Anatole:]
Anatole smiled
The reflection of that base and cringing smile
Which Pierre knew so well in his wife
Revolted him
[Pierre:]
Oh, vile and heartless brood!
[Anatole:]
Next day Anatole left
For Petersburg! 
[Sonya:]
Natasha very ill
The whole house
A state of alarm and commotion
Natasha very ill
Having poisoned herself
With a bit of arsenic
She woke me in the middle of the night
And told me what she had done
And the doctors
And the antidotes
And now she is out of danger
But still so weak
And Andrey is to return
We wait with dread

[Andrey visits Pierre
[Andrey:]
Well, how are you?
Still getting stouter?
[Pierre:]
"There's a new wrinkle", 'On your forehead old friend
[Andrey:]
"It's good to see you", "I've been away too long", '
[Pierre:]
My friend, you are in need
Your face is gloomy
[Andrey:]
No, I am well
"There's a war going on", '
Forgive me for troubling you
I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova
And have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand
Or something of that kind
Is this true?
[Pierre:]
Something of that kind
[Andrey:]
Here are her letters
Please give them to the Countess
[Pierre:]
Natasha is ill
"She has been at death's door", '
[Andrey:]
I much regret her illness
[Pierre:]
And he smiled like his father
Coldly, maliciously
[Andrey:]
"Well, it doesn't matter", '
[Pierre:]
You told me once
A fallen woman should be forgiven
[Andrey:]
But I didn't say that I could forgive", "I can't", '
Yes, ask her hand again
Be magnanimous, and so on
Yes, that would be very noble
"But I can't be that man", 'If you wish to be my friend
Never speak of that again
Well, goodbye
[Pierre takes the letters to Natasha
[Pierre:]
Natasha was standing
In the middle of the drawing room
With a pale yet steady face
When I appeared in the doorway
She grew flustered and I hurried to her
I thought that she would give me her hand
But instead she stopped
Breathing heavily
Her thin arms hanging lifelessly
Just in the very pose
She used to stand in as a young girl
When she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing
But the look on her face was quite different
[Natasha:]
Peter Kirilovich
[Pierre:]
Pierre
[Natasha:]
Prince Bolkonsky was your friend
He is your friend
He once told me that I should turn to you
[Pierre:]
"Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but he didn't speak", "'Til then he had reproached her, and tried to despise her", 'But now he felt such pity for her
That there was no room in his soul for reproach
[Natasha:]
He is here now
Tell him to, tell him to forgive me
[Pierre:]
Yes, I will tell him to forgive you
But, he gave me your letters
[Natasha:]
No, I know that all is over
I know that it never can be
"But still I'm tormented by the wrongs I've done him", 'Tell him that I beg him to forgive, forgive
Forgive me for everything
[Pierre:]
Yes I will tell him, tell him everything
But
But I should like to know one thing
Did you love
Did you love that bad man?
[Natasha:]
"Don't call him bad", "But I don't know, I don't know at all", '
[Pierre:]
She began to cry
"And a greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love overflowed Pierre's heart", 'He felt the tears begin to trickle underneath his spectacles
And he hoped that no one would see

"We won't speak of it anymore", "We won't speak of it, my dear", 'But one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend
And if you ever need help, or simply to open your heart to someone
Not now, but when your mind is clear
Think of me
[Pierre grew confused
[Natasha:]
"Don't speak to me like that", 'I am not worth it!
[Pierre:]
Stop, stop, stop!
You have your whole life before you
[Natasha:]
Before me? No, all is over for me!
[Pierre:]
All over?
[Music stops
If I were not myself
But the brightest, handsomest
Best man on earth
And if I were free
I would get down on my knees this minute
And ask you for your hand
And for your love
[Music resumes
[Natasha:]
And for the first time in many days
I weep tears of gratitude
Tears of tenderness
Tears of thanks
And glancing at Pierre
Oh Pierre
I leave the room smiling
[Pierre:]
And restraining tears of tenderness
Tears of joy which choke me
I throw my fur coat on my shoulders
Unable to find the sleeves
Outside, my great broad chest
Breathes in deep the air with joy
Despite the ten degrees of frost
And I get into my sleigh
[Pierre:]
Where to now?
Where can I go now?
Not to the club
Not to pay calls
Mankind seems so pitiful
So poor
Compared to that softened, grateful, last glance
She gave me through her tears
[Chorus:]
It was clear and cold
Above the dirty streets
Above the black roofs
Stretched the dark starry sky
[Pierre:]
This vast firmament
Open to my eyes
Wet with tears
[Chorus:]
And there in the middle
Above Prechistensky Boulevard
Surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
Shines The Great Comet of 1812
The Brilliant Comet of 1812
[Pierre:]
The comet said to portend
Untold horrors
And the end of the world
But for me
The comet brings no fear
No, I gaze joyfully
And this bright star
Having traced its parabola
With inexpressible speed
Through immeasurable space
Seems suddenly
To have stopped
Like an arrow piercing the earth
Stopped for me
It seems to me
That this comet
Feels me
Feels my softened and uplifted soul
And my newly melted heart
Now blossoming
Into a new life
