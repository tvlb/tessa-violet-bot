This hurt that I'm holding's getting heavy
But I'mma keep a smile on my shoulders 'til I'm sweaty
Begging on my knees
Screamin' "someone come and help me"
But by the time they're there
I've already hid the body
My breath's gettin' short and I'm unsteady
Wellin' up in tears as I lay upon your belly
Telling you I'm fine
I don't really need nobody
But you say through a sigh
That I said that lie already
I just needed company now
Yeah, I just needed someone around
Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
Or mess that we make
Just company now
Comfort crowd
Comfort crowd
We rot thinkin' lots about nothing
Yeah, I could spend a lifetime
Sitting here talkin'
And even if I cry all over your body
You don't really mind
Say you like your shirt soggy
Yeah, I just needed company now
Yeah, I just needed someone around
Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
Or mess that we make
Just company now
Comfort crowd
Comfort crowd
We mess around
And laugh too loud
And make the sounds
We try to hide when people are around
By blood we're bound
Through ups and downs
Their smiles and pouts
Comfort crowd
You can always count
Yeah, I just needed company now
Yeah, I just needed someone around
Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
Or mess that we make
Just company now
Comfort crowd 
(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
This party's shit, wish we could dip
Go anywhere but here
Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips
And please don't drink more beer
I'ma crawl out the window now
'Cause I don't like anyone around
Kinda hope you're following me out
But this is definitely not my crowd
Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'till the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
Trip down the road, walking you home
You kiss me at your door
Pulling me close, beg me stay over
But I'm over this roller-coaster
I'ma crawl out the window now
Getting good at saying, "gotta bounce"
Honestly you always let me down
And I know we're not just hanging out
Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'till the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish you were sober
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish you were sober
Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'till the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober 
(Maniac)
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You just went too far, wrecked your car
Call me crying in the dark
Now you're breaking my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)
Psychopathic, don't be so dramatic
We had magic, but you made it tragic
Now you're manic, honestly I've had it
Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac
You only pass through my city
Every once in a million seconds, on a broken clock
Yet we talk like we're living
Only miles, only minutes from another
Just around the block
As I stare at my screen
Shining blue and green
All alone in a coffee shop
I can't help but imagine
What maybe could've happened
If you weren't just an online love 
You think you're funny right?
Calling me drunk when it's too late at night
Telling me truths that you know all are lies
Yeah, you think you're funny right
You think you're super sly
Flirting with them but telling me you're mine
Building me up, but buttercup you lied
Now I'm gonna ruin your life
'Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river till you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate
Yeah you may think you're winning but checkmate
Now this is getting fun
I saw you kissing someone else's tongue
You said that I'm the only one you love
Baby this is getting fun
I'll let you think you won
Date in the park I'll play it super dumb
Holding your hand but in the other one
I'm holding a loaded gun
Yeah baby you should really run
'Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river till you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate
Yeah you may think you're winning but check
And I'm gonna get you gone
Can't play me like your pawn
Set fire to your lawn
Just like you did to my heart
And I'mma wreck your car (and I'mma wreck your car)
And max your credit cards (and max your credit cards)
A lover on the large (a lover on the large)
You're gonna wish you never harmed me
Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river till you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate
And you did some damage so I'm making you pay
And no one's ever gonna love you anyways
'Cause you're just a narcissist who's totally fake
Yeah you may think you're winning this heartbreak
But you aren't gonna win it 'cause checkmate 
I don't love you anymore
A pretty line that I adore
Five words that I've heard before
'Cause you keep me on a rope
And tied a noose around my throat
You're gone, then back at my door
'Cause if you're gonna leave
Better leave, better do it fast
Can't live a little longer
Sitting on your lap
'Cause you know what you're doing
When you're coming back
And I don't want to have
Another heart attack
Oh, I can't be
Your lover on a leash
Every other week
When you please
Oh, I can't be
The kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds
The cut that always bleeds
Say you love somebody new
And beat my heart, to black and blue
Then they leave, and it's me
You come back to
To say you loved me all along
And kissed the bruises 'til they're gone
Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe
Inside your arms
'Cause if you're gonna leave
Better leave, better do it fast
Can't live another minute
Bleeding from my back
'Cause I don't have another one
For you to stab
And I don't want to have
Another heart attack
Oh, I can't be
Your lover on a leash
Every other week
When you please
Oh, I can't be
The kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds
The cut that always bleeds
But even though you're killing me
I, I need you like the air I breathe
I need, I need you more than me
I need you more than anything
Please, Please
'Cause I could be
Your lover on a leash
Every other week
When you please
Oh, I could be
Anything you need
As long as you don't leave
The cut that always 
Something's gotten into you
You don't really look at me the way you used to
And I'm hoping it ain't true
Every single rumor that I've heard of you
Say you were off with someone that I don't know
Callin' other people on your telephone
Kinda wish I didn't know
Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up
As you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight?
You tell me it ain't what it seems
But, baby, this is lookin' like a crime scene
There's clothes thrown on the balcony
And you smell like perfume out a magazine
I'm throwing all your shit outta my window
Telling you I wish that we had never spoke
Baby, I already know
Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up
As you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight?
Now there's someone at my door
Someone I've not met before
They've got eyes like mine, a pretty smile
And they've been crying for a while
'Cause they also didn't know
That our lover loved us both
Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up
As you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight? 
Mama's got a new man
And daddy's got a new mansion to keep
He never really calls back
'Cause he's got too many finances to reap
Money, money
Ain't it funny, honey
When you get what you need
Baby, life is a breeze
Money, money
Give me money, money
'Til I'm bloody, bloody
All these kids have got affluenza
Going wrecking their daddy's Benza
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh oh
They say money can't buy you no love
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluence oh, affluenza, affluenza
Every day's your birthday
You threw a party but you kinda
Hate all your friends
So you're crying in a drive-way
Killing time, getting high
Can't wait 'til it ends
Money, money
Ain't it funny, honey
When you get what you need
Baby, life is a breeze
Money, money
Give me money, money
'Til I'm bloody, bloody
All these kids have got affluenza
Going wrecking their daddy's Benza
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh oh
They say money can't buy you no love
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluence oh, affluenza, affluenza
Fat stacks, cold cash
You've always had it real lavish, first-class
Trust fund, gold tongue
Eighty grand in both your hands, but no love
All these kids have got affluenza
Going wrecking their daddy's Benza
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh oh
They say money can't buy you no love
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluence oh, affluenza, affluenza 
Could you be my best friend?
Let's hang out every weekend
Go driving every night
Stare at people that we like
Could you be my best friend?
I'll tell you all my secrets
I'll tell you all the times
That I wish that I could die
And if anybody fucks with you
They fuck with me
So, if anybody fucks with you
I'll knock their teeth out, yeah
Could you be my best friend?
Can we be friends?
Could you be my best friend?
Can we be friends? 
I still remember
Third of December
Me in your sweater
You said it looked better
On me, than it did you
Only if you knew
How much I liked you
But I watch your eyes, as she
Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half, as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with
Her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her?
She's such an angel
But then again, kinda
Wish she were dead, as she
Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half, as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
I wish I were Heather
Wish I were Heather
Wish I were Heather
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were 
Do you remember days on our old block?
Messing with our neighbors, who called the cops
Coulda swore that you and me
Could get away with anything
We'd lay on the grass, all day talking
'Cause we snuck out of class when no one was watching
I remember you and me
Yeah, I remember everything
But, lately I've been feeling strange
And everybody's telling me to act my age
I never thought that everything I had, would fade away
When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free
Little league
And when we were younger
We wore our hearts out on our sleeves
Why did we ever have to leave?
Little league
Could I get a rewind?
Get another chance, take it back in time
'Cause I don't know what to do
With everything I'm going through
And where did all my friends go?
Standing on our street but nobody's home
Swore we'd never move away
But now I'm going ninety-five on the interstate
'Cause, lately I've been feeling strange
And everybody's telling me to act my age
I never thought that everything I had, would fade away
When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free
Little league
And when we were younger
We wore our hearts out on our sleeves
Why did we ever have to leave?
Little league
I wish I was younger
Wish I was younger
When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free
Little league
And when we were younger
We wore our hearts out on our sleeves
Why did we ever have to leave?
Little league 
Let me tell you a story
About a boy and a girl
It's kinda short, kinda boring
But the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen
When the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves
And now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn
And when I was younger
I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other
But always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one other
But never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid
Of what they'd say
Moved to different states
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Now it's on to the sequel
About me and my friend
Both our parents were evil
So we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved
We could both run away
And we'd have a better life
And I was right
I wonder if she's alright
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
OK
And the movie's always running in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
